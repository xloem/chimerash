- making the lifetime of the mount wrapped by the launching method seems like a consistent approach.
  one single process could be launched, like shelling in, and then leaving that process would leave the remote server.
- looking into how sshfs performs remote connection (likely links to openssh) could remove the ssh subprocess spawning
- moving the guts into a standalone daemon could make things more robust and open options
- implementing remote mounting without sshfs could provide for further speed gains
